<h2 align="center" >Meet the colors.</h2>
<p align="center">
	Every great theme starts with great colors. <br>
	Five are not enough. Seven are too many. <br>
	A family of six, beautiful colors was chosen <br>
	through a critical and structured process.
</p>

<!-- Contrast -->

<h3 align="center">Have your eye candy. And see it, too.</h3>
<p align="center">
	All six colors were painstakingly tested for ergonomics, <br>
	legibility, and aesthetics on several monitor configurations, <br>
	including sRGB, Adobe RGB, miscalibrated, grayscale, HDR, <br>
	high-contrast, low-contrast, f.lux, and more.
</p>

<h3 align="center">Multichromatic. Monochromatic.</h3>
<p align="center">
	All colors were tested together in a monochromatic <br>
	environment to ensure their contrast levels match so <br>
	no single color catches your eye more than the others do.
